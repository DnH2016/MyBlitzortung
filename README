All maps are free, but have different licenses! == Maps created with map tool on blitzortung.org (Data from ETOPO Ice Surface) ==- Europe (normal and mini)- Germany (only mini)- Switzerland== Wikipedia / Wikimedia Commons ==- Germany ("Landkreise" / counties)  Created by user TUBS   see http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Landkreise,_Kreise_und_kreisfreie_St%C3%A4dte_in_Deutschland.svg  Be careful: This map has no real mercator projection, strike positions are not exact!  Feel free to create a better map from free sources!  - Germany (Bavaria/NRW)   Wikimedia Commons, Licence GNU-Documentation or CC-BY-SA   see http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bavaria_relief_location_map.jpg)    ******************** 2. REQUIREMENTS ********************- Apache web server (other web servers untested)- MySQL 5 (Version 4 untested)- PHP 5 (it won't work with PHP4!)- about 100 MB of free memory for database and cache files (and much more if you want to archive all data)*************** 3. SUPPORT ***************- See FAQ in this document- See this thread: http://www.wetter-board.de/index.php?page=Thread&threadID=47554  Of course, you can ask questions there in english. It would also be great to hear of successful installations.- Official Blitzortung FAQ Site: http://www.faq-blitzortung.org/*************** 4. HELPING ***************EVERYBODY CAN HELP BY SUPPORTING OTHER USERS AND BY DEVELOPING THIS PROGRAM!- Adding new translations- Improve and add features- Adding maps of other countries- Find AND report bugs- Support other users******************** 5. INSTALLATION ********************1. Get the files----------------Download the archive from:--> https://github.com/tobiasv/MyBlitzortungBe careful: You should download a tagged version, otherwise you will get the developer code, which may not work properly!2. Copy the files-----------------Copy the files from the archive to your webserver (usually with FTP).For example, we use the directory "mybo" here, or in the browser "http://yourdomain.tld/mybo".3. Call the installation script-------------------------------Call "http://yourdomain.tld/mybo/install". The installer will guide you through the installation process. The hardest thing is to create your own "config.php". The database will be installed automatically. See www.myblitzortung.org for additional config.php options and configuration examples.4. Change permission of the cache directories---------------------------------------------Change permissions of the directories, so that the web server can write in it. Usually the permissions are set to "777".- cache- cache/tiles- cache/maps- cache/icons5. Setup data import--------------------Now you have to set up the automatic data import. The link for that is displayed in the last step of the installation process. You can create an own cron entry, or an entry in the windows tasks. The easiest way is to use an external provider like http://cronjob.deUpdate frequency: You can call the URL every minute. There is an internal timer, that prevents accessing the files on the blitzortung server to much. Default settings for this timer for strike updates is 5 Minutes, for stations 15 and for signals 60. You can change these values in config.php.6. Configuration----------------The essential configuration was already done in config.php. But there are a lot of other settings, that you can change or add individually in this file. See www.myblitzortung.org for more details.7. Install JpGraph------------------JpGraph is used for creating the graphs. You can get it at http://jpgraph.net/download/ . Copy the files from the JpGraph "src" direcory to includes/jpgraph. You can omit the directories src/barcode, src/Examples and all files beginnig width <em>flag</em>. No further installation is needed!8. Check if everything works----------------------------Call http://yourdomain.tld/mybo and you should see the map. You can now login with your blitzortung username and password.UPDATING========To update MyBlitzortung you have to download the new archive, extract it and copy the new files over the old files. Your own files (config.php, individual maps) shouldn't be overwritten. Immediately after that, you should enter the user area, to automatically update the database.Downgrading might not work this way! Note: Before the update, you should always create a backup of your database!	********************* 6. TRANSLATIONS  *********************For adding new languages, there is a file called "helper.php" in the locales directory. Open the file and you will see some instructions about adding new translations.If you've made some translations, please send them back to <mail@myblitzortung.de>. You should do that, even if you've translated only some parts. 	***************** 7.
